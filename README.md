## VendingMachine

## üì¶ Project Description
This project simulates the operation of a vending machine for selling beverages. It allows user interaction via an HW-834 keypad and an LCD1602A display, as well as integration with an application built in the LabVIEW environment.  
The FRDM-KL05Z microcontroller, programmed in C using Keil uVision5, reads data from the keypad and transmits it to the LabVIEW application.

## üéÆ Features

**Product selection simulation:**  
The user can select a product using the keypad, which is read by the microcontroller and sent to the LabVIEW application.

**Dynamic product prices and positions:**  
The LabVIEW interface allows the user to freely change the prices and positions of available products.

**Coin insertion simulation:**  
The user can simulate inserting specific coin denominations into the machine.

**Product dispensing and change calculation:**  
If the inserted amount is sufficient, the machine dispenses the selected product and calculates and returns the correct change.

**Information display:**  
All data, such as balance, product price, and error messages, are displayed on the LCD1602A screen.
