# VendingMachine

## 1. Program Functionality

The program simulates a vending machine for beverages. It allows us to send data read by the FRDM-KL05Z microcontroller from the keyboard, thus simulating the selection of products in the vending machine. The LabView program provides the ability to freely change prices, product positions, simulate inserting money into the machine, dispensing the product (if funds > prices), and dispensing the calculated change accordingly.
The microcontroller was programmed in the Keil uVision5 environment using the C language. To observe the results, I used the LCD1602A display and the HW-834 keyboard.
